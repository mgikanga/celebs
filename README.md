Ron Notes -

Discontinued using facebook API to call information because of the recent Facebook Privacy compromise.  The main issue using the FB api is the limited functionality of the API in regards to accessing other users and profile information.  However, the app was able to function in gathering the signed in user's data and info.  This is an issue because this limits the app's ability to call data of other users.  In conclusion, our efforts shift from configuring the FB API to other social media APIS (twitter, instagram, twitch).
